# TIAA Forum Website Rebuild Project

## Objective
Rebuild tiaa-forum.org using Elementor Pro based on a new design created in Replit. The goal is an MVP that volunteer maintainers with basic WordPress experience (but potentially limited Elementor Pro knowledge) can support long-term.

## Current Tech Stack
- WordPress with Hello Elementor theme
- Elementor Pro for all page building and templates
- Custom plugin: tiaa-wpplugin (handles forum signups and welcome messages)
- WP-Discourse plugin: Discourse SSO integration
- WP SimplePay plugin (Stripe payment processing)
- Hosting: dev local on macOS, test/production hosted on DigitalOcean VPS in a docker compose stack
- Development environment: IntelliJ IDEA with Docker Compose plugin to test locally
- Version control: GitHub: https://github.com/tiaa-forum-org/tiaa-wpsite-v3.git

## Critical Constraints
- MUST preserve: Discourse SSO integration (forum signup/login flow)
- MUST preserve: Existing anchor links in Hot Topics (e.g., #hotline, #webstart, #voting)
- MUST preserve: Contact forms and Join form functionality
- Team skill level: Comfortable with WordPress admin, variable experience with Elementor Pro's Theme Builder
- Preference: Elementor-native solutions over custom code when possible
- Preference: When custom code is required, process is to use cut-and-paste working code assets from a maintained GitHub repo

## Design Source
New design vibe-coded in Replit at https://techtaalk.replit.app/
- Clean, modern aesthetic with navy (#1a2340), teal (#3bbfad), coral (#e8856a) color palette
- Single sans-serif font (likely Inter or similar)
- Responsive mobile-first design
- Modify existing WordPress presentation to use posts instead of pages where SEO calls for it
- See uploaded Replit source files and screenshots for details

## Working Style Preferences
- Give step-by-step Elementor instructions suitable for someone learning Theme Builder
- Explain *why* we're doing something, not just *how* (helps volunteers understand and maintain)
- Flag any sections that require plugins or custom CSS upfront
- Default to simple, maintainable solutions over complex ones
- When you need to see design details, I'll share screenshots in the conversation
- Use the GitHub repo for code assets
- Document major decisions in the repo's decision log

## Key Pages to Build
- Home (hero, features, stats, categories)
- Hot Topics (curated discussion archive with search/filter - TBD on complexity)
  Note: Hot Topics are curated summaries of popular forum discussions, not live forum content
- The Forum (explainer pages, join flow)
- About Us, Contact Us
- Contribution page for logged in users only
- 404 and other templates
